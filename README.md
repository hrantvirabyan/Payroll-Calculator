# Payroll-Calculator
a program that inputs a filename from the user and prints to the terminal a report of the wages paid to the employees for the given period.

The report should be in tabular format with the appropriate header.
Each line should contain:
An employeeâ€™s name
The hours worked
The wages paid for that period.
An example of the program input and output is shown below:

Enter the file name: data.txt

Name            Hours      Total Pay
Lambert            34         357.00
Osborne            22         137.50
Giacometti          5         503.50
